# Persistent Game Settings

This repository contains the complete Unity project for the YouTube tutorial:
**[How to Save Game Settings in Unity as JSON](https://youtu.be/jkKx5Ogm51g)**

This project gives scriptable objects "memory," ensuring data persists between game sessions. This can be used to save game configuration settings, serializing values to JSON for disk saving. Upon launch, values populate the scriptable object and adjust controls.
