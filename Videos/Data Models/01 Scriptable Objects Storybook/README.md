# Scriptable Objects Storybook

This repository contains the complete Unity project for the YouTube tutorial:
**[Making a Storybook in Unity with Scriptable Objects](https://youtu.be/jZeX9Bmo_6Q)**

Scriptable objects act as data containers and can exist independent of any scene or game object. This project covers how to construct a digital storybook using scriptable objects to hold the page data. Two approaches are used: an array-based structure and a node-based linked list system.
